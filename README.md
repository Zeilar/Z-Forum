My first Laravel project - made for my examination.

Log in as any user with the password "123" - you can log in as moderator/superadmin to see special toolbar functionality among other things.

If the site is in maintenance mode, you can log in as an admin on /admin-login. User "Philip" will always be a superadmin, with password "123" as default.
